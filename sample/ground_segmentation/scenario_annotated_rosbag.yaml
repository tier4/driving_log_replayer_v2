  Conditions:
    Method: annotated_rosbag # Data types used as GroundTruth data.(annotated_rosbag : input_bag contains annotated pointcloud data, annotated_pcd : annotated pcd.bin file located at t4_dataset/dataset/data/LIDAR_CONCAT/*.pcd.bin)

    obstacle_label: 0 # Annotation label for obstacle pointcloud.
    accuracy_min: 0.7 # If the accuracy is lower than the threshold value, the evaluation is considered to have failed.
    accuracy_max: 1.0
    PassRate: 99.0 # How much (%) of the evaluation attempts are considered successful.

# Note : When running ground_segmentation in 'annotated_rosbag' mode,
# it is necessary to modify the sensing module of autoware.universe as follows:
#
# https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/blob/main/sensing/autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor/src/filter.cpp#L383-L390
#  ...
#     if (utils::is_data_layout_compatible_with_point_xyzi(*cloud)) {
#      RCLCPP_ERROR(
#        get_logger(),
#        "The pointcloud layout is compatible with PointXYZI. You may be using legacy "
#        "code/data");
#    }
#
#    // return; <- comment out!
